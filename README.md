## Raspberry Pi Golf Replay System

This project uses readily available materials to create a video replay system for the Raspberry Pi for use by golfers

### Materials Needed
- [Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb)](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi&qid=1590900503&sr=8-4)
  - Untested on other versions/configurations of the Pi, but should work on any reasonably recent iteration
- [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+camera&qid=1590900526&sr=8-1)
  - New High-Quality Camera works as well (perhaps better), but probably warrants the new 8gb Pi for processing


#### Optional Materials
