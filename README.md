# Pi Golf Replay

## THIS PROJECT IN CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS. CHECK BACK LATER FOR UPDATES! (May 31, 2020)

## **What To Buy**
### Required Materials
- [Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb)](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Model-2019-Quad-Bluetooth/dp/B07TC2BK1X/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi&qid=1590900503&sr=8-4)
  - Untested on other versions/configurations of the Pi, but should work on any reasonably recent iteration
- [Raspberry Pi Camera Module](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+camera&qid=1590900526&sr=8-1)
  - New High-Quality Camera works as well (perhaps better), but probably warrants the new 8gb Pi for processing
- Any monitor that accepts HDMI input
- Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable
- USB Mouse
- [USB-C Power Cable](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/type-c-power-supply/)
  - While any USB-C cable will connect, it  might be either too much or too little power so I reccomend buying one designed for the Pi
- Micro SD Card for the Operating System
  - 16GB should be regarded as the bare minimum. Many are sold with Pi OS preinstalled
  
### Optional Materials
- Raspberry Pi Starter  Kit
  - There are a variety of these on the internet, and they often come bundled with a case and the required hdmi and power cables
- [Two Step Pedal System](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QDRPDS2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  - Used in the appendix, this is not required but a nice touch and saves disk space down the line
- USB or Bluetooth Keyboard
  - Not necessary if you intend to only use SSH for the initialization, but convinient for ironing out bugs and making quick changes without the constraints of VNC

## Step 0: Set up the Raspberry Pi
You can skip this step if you have already set up your Pi.

There are countless guides online to set up your Raspberry Pi. I inlcuded some below for your convinience. This guide assumes that Raspbian Buster is installed. All you need to do is get the OS installed to proceed to Step 1. To verify that you have, simply plug the Pi into a monitor and verify that you are guided to a Desktop.

### Guides for basic setup (You just need to pick one)
- [Official Raspberry Pi Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/)
- [HowToForge Guide](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/howto-install-raspbian-on-raspberry-pi/)
- [ThePi.io Guide](https://thepi.io/how-to-install-raspbian-on-the-raspberry-pi/)
